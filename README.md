<h3>The Impact of AI in Telecom</h3>
AI technology is becoming a significant focus in the Telecommunications industry, with discussions centred around its applications. Telcos are using AI, which encompasses Deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP), to discover valuable information, enhance customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and boost revenue. Telcos must consider whether they are utilising this technology effectively to address their business needs

<h3>Telemetry</h3>
Telemetry is the in situ collection of measurements or other data at remote points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment (telecommunication) for monitoring. That means monitoring not only your base telecom equipment but also all the equipment that supports it. In the ever-advancing world of technology, the demand for next-generation telemetry systems is on the rise. Building a strong foundation for next-gen telemetry systems starts with establishing a reliable telecommunications infrastructure.

<h3>RF Optimization</h3>
As a shared medium, wireless signal may be competing to broadcast. Broader technology trends see the density of clients continuing to increase dramatically. Optimization is an important step in the life cycle of a wireless network. Overall, RF optimization is a complex, iterative process that demands a deep understanding of radio wave behavior, network architecture, and advanced tools to ensure optimal performance and quality of wireless communication networks.
